## What It Is

Developers far and wide are familiar with GitHub. This project showcases my abilities to replicate another person's design (i.e. working with a designer's comp) and also my ability to make API requests and handle the response JSON data. In this project I also used Handlebars.js to make stamps of repeating elements and Git/GitHub for source control.
